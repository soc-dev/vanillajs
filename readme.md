# Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript

This is the main repository for all of the projects in the course.

NOTE ON  PROJECT: All of these projects are part of the course. While I do appreciate people trying to make some things prettier or adding new features, we are only accepting pull requests and looking at issues for bug fixes so that the code stays inline with the course
